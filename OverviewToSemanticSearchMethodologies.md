# Introduction #

Searching a big data is a complicated job and it's time consuming. Tagging helps users to find the content they are looking for but non-semantic tagging has some disadvantages to show relevant data. Semantic tagging and searching provides a better result by including semantics(some meaningful description to tags).

# Details #

Some of disadvantages of non-semantic tagging are:

  * Polysemy (the same word can refer to different concepts),

  * synonymy (the same concept can be pointed out using different words),

  * different lexical forms (different noun forms, different verb conjugation, acronyms, different languages),

  * misspelling errors

These problems may lead us to irrelevant results. However, with the help of semantic searching, searching methods look for more relevant results. Since the tags now have a meaning, semantic searching methods search the data in a way that is more realistic and provide better results.
