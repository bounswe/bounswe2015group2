# What is semantic tagging and why do we need it? #

Let's say we are managing a very big chunk of data (e.g. a mailbox of a person with lots of e-mails in it). When the time comes, we will need to extract some data from that pool because we will need that particular information. Traditionally, to do that we simply conduct a full search through the data pool which is time consuming or ,worse, may end up with false failure (We do not find the information even though it exists in the pool, due to human-errors). Semantic tagging allows us to attach "meaningful description words" for each datum so that we can classify data and we can increase findability and search speed. Therefore we need semantic tagging in order to decrease chance of error and time spent on the search. We call this type of tagging "semantic" because tags are to be read by human-beings which necessitates the "text" of tags to be meaningful in human-spoken languages. As a result of this concept tags are created, edited, deleted, etc by the particular person who would like to manage the big data.

# Semantic HTML Elements #

Html is using xml tags to treat and/or classify the contents of the web-page. In html, some tags are semantic (like `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<img>`) because they describe their content pretty clearly, whereas some are non-semantic (like `<div>` and `<span>`) because they don't tell anything about their content. Since people are coding/designing the web-pages, they are more comfortable with using meaningful (semantic) text when they create tags. Therefore when they use dummy tags (like `<div>`) they give them meaningful attributes such as `<div id="nav">` (nav stands for navigation). Since this application is quite often, HTML5 brought some extra semantic tags such as `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<details>` etc. Some of the semantic tags are as following (including the ones came with HTML5);



  * `<article>`  _Defines an article_
  * `<aside>` _Defines content aside from the page content_
  * `<details>` _Defines additional details that the user can view or hide_
  * `<figcaption>` _Defines a caption for a `<figure>` element_
  * `<figure>` _Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc._
  * `<footer>` _Defines a footer for a document or section_
  * `<header>` _Specifies a header for a document or section_
  * `<main>` _Specifies the main content of a document_
  * `<mark>` _Defines marked/highlighted text_
  * `<nav>` _Defines navigation links_
  * `<section>` _Defines a section in a document_
  * `<summary>`	_Defines a visible heading for a `<details>` element_
  * `<time>`	_Defines a date/time_
  * `<form>` _Defines an HTML form for user input._
  * `<table>` _Defines a an HTML table consisting of the `<table>` element and one or more `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements._
  * `<img>` _Defines an image_

# The Purpose of Semantic Tagging #
> The main purpose of the Semantic tagging is driving the evolution of the current data by enabling users to find, share, and combine information more easily. Humans are capable of using the data to carry out tasks such as finding the German translation for "eight days", reserving a library book, and searching for the lowest price for a DVD. However, machines cannot accomplish all of these tasks without human direction, because web pages are designed to be read by people, not machines. The semantic is a vision of information that can be readily interpreted by machines, so machines can perform more of the tedious work involved in finding, combining, and acting upon information. It uses metadata as well.
> The Semantic tagging, as originally envisioned, is a system that enables machines to "understand" and respond to complex human requests based on their meaning. Such an "understanding" requires that the relevant information sources be semantically structured.
# The Gains of Semantic Tagging #
> We can simply mention the gains of the semantic technology
    * enabling a tag standardization by adding a meaning;
    * connecting Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web with semantic tags;
    * connecting Wikipedia and social bookmarking;
    * re-using RDF data available on the Web;
    * facilitating information integration and knowledge discovery
    * facilitating communication between different services;
    * enabling auto-classification and multilingual semantic tagging;
# What is Semantic Search? #
[What is semantic search?](https://code.google.com/p/bounswe2015group2/wiki/WhatIsSemanticSearch)

Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding searcher intent and the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable dataspace, whether on the Web or within a closed system, to generate more relevant results.Semantic search systems consider various points including context of search, location, intent, variation of words, synonyms, generalized and specialized queries, concept matching and natural language queries to provide relevant search results.Major web search engines like Google and Bing incorporate some elements of semantic search.

We can distinguish two important forms of search ; navigational and research .In navigational search, the user is using the search engine as a navigation tool to navigate to a particular intended document. Semantic search is not applicable to this kind of searches. In research search, the user provides the search engine with a phrase which is intended to denote an object about which the user is trying to gather/research information. There is no particular document which the user knows about and is trying to get to. Rather, the user is trying to locate a number of documents which together will provide the desired information.

Semantic search works on the principles of language semantics. Unlike typical search algorithms, semantic search is based on the context, substance, intent and concept of the searched phrase. Semantic search also incorporates location, synonyms of a term, current trends, word variations and other natural language elements as part of the search. Semantic search concepts are derived from various search algorithms and methodologies, including keyword-to-concept mapping and graph patterns.
