Hello, it is Sıla Güler (the Communicator of the team). I graduated from Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department of Boğaziçi University in 2012. Then, I started to work as a Consultant in IBM. After 2 years of experience I decided to deepen my knowledge in Computer Engineering. Right now, I am studying MSc in Computer Engineering. I have knowledge on C and C++ (intermediate). Besides my academic background, I was involved in a data warehouse modeling project, and a web implementation project at IBM. But, I didn't work as a software engineer, my main contribution was conducting the analysis work throughout both of the projects.
