# Emulating Android Applications #

In order to ensure your application that you are developing running like you want, you should install and run it on a device or you should use an program that emulates an Android device. Running on a real device takes too much time so most of the programmers prefer an emulator.

Android Development Kit comes with a emulator but it takes ~10 minutes to boot up and its performance is too low. There are some tools that replaces Android's default emulator.

  * Genymotion
  * Manymo

Genymotion is the most known and used emulator for Android. According to their website it is used by 2,500,000 developers. Genymotion uses VirtualBox to emulate an Android OS so it explains why it is faster than the default one. It comes with two version: the free one, the paid one. If you are standard application developer who does not need extra features, the free version should be enough for you.

You can add a new emulator or start already created emulator. When you start an emulator, it is like a device that connects computer via cable so in your development environment you should choose run in device not run in emulator.

Manymo is a very different emulating tool. It emulates android devices on cloud so you do not need install any program into your computer. Unfortunately, Manymo does not have any free package. The main benefit of using Manymo, you can share your works to any people just using one link and also you can emulate more devices in the same time (it is too hard on your local computer because of ram consumption)
