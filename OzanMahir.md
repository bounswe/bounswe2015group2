Hello, I am Ozan. I am a graduate student at Computer Engineering Department. Now I am taking remedial courses. I have a B.A. degree from the Philosophy Department of Boğaziçi University. I work at Google as a linguist. I have only taken a course on C programming so far. Probably I know less when compared to all of you, yet I can assure you that I will try to do my best.
