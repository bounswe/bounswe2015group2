## General knowledge about the domain ##
Our project is focusing on the domains of food, wellness and sharing the common tastes. In today's world, we are provided with a wide range of foods not only by food provider companies, but also by lots of restaurants, cafes etc. But, we have little information about which food product or recipe is more appropriate for our taste and health unless we try. Besides, we don't know the nutritional information of the foods we consumed in a restaurant or our home. In order to provide these information to food consumers in these domains, some crowd sourcing applications come up with a system linking the food providers and consumers of food based on healthy data.

## Customers and Users ##
Users of this application are:
  * Food consumers who are caring about:
    * which nutrients exist in what they eat, getting guidance about food/nutrition intake
    * getting recommendations based on their preferences, food history and health condition
    * sharing some delicious recipes for other users to cook
    * sharing their experiences about food or a food provider in various aspects
    * listening others' experiences
  * Food providers who are caring about:
    * increasing food consumers' awareness by creating social buzz
    * sharing delicious recipes or daily menus inviting food consumers to try their food and letting them to know the nutritional elements of what they eat
    * getting feedback from consumers in order to provide them with more delicious or healthier food

## Environment ##

In this project, we are going to develop web and Android applications. And, we are going to provide API for both of these platforms.

## Competing Software ##

### 1. My Fitness Pal ###

#### **Description** ####
My Fitness Pal is a free calorie counter application. It provides its users with over 5 million foods in their database.

#### **Key Features** ####
  * Keeping track of the calorie users take from foods
  * Keeping track of the calorie users burn during an exercise
  * Accessing database via search food name functionality
  * Accessing database via bar code reading functionality
  * Calculating nutrient share of the foods that users consumed in repast basis

  * Integration with Facebook
#### **Users** ####
Food consumers are the only users of this application.
#### **Environment** ####
It provides both web and mobile apps, and these apps are synchronized automatically so that users diaries are always up-to-date.
#### **Differences** ####
Main difference between My Fitness Pal and our app is that My Fitness Pal is only for the use of food consumers not for the use of food providers. My Fitness Pal app concentrates on helping food consumers to track their food intake, but it does not recommend a food, a recipe or a restaurant based on its users' food history or health condition. Food consumers can share some recipes but they are required to enter calorie, the amount of protein, fat and carbohydrate for the recipe. Nutritional value of the recipes is not computed based on the ingredients, it's entered by users which decreases data reliability.
There doesn't exist a food provider profile, they can not share daily menus or recipes, there is no rating system.

### 2. Foursquare ###

#### **Environment** ####
It provides both web and mobile apps.
#### **Differences** ####
Main difference between Foursquare and our project is that Foursquare is used not only by the people who are looking for food, people are using to find some bars, hair designers, sport clubs etc. And, it is assertive about recommending places to its users based on their preferences via tagging system. It is not one of the food tracking applications. It does not give any calorie or nutrient information about the food.

### 3. Healthy Food ###

#### **Users** ####
Cooks, and food consumers who are caring for eating healthy
#### **Environment** ####
This provides a web app.
#### **Differences** ####
Main difference between our project and healthy food is that Healthy food is more like a portal in which its users find useful information about eating healthy. It does not only focus on recipes, but also, it focuses on blogs, news and magazines about food and health.  Itâ€™s a web site for cooks to find recipes, see its nutritional info, learn how to cook, and give feedback for them after they try. In the sense that users can get nutritional and health info about a recipe, this web site is similar to our application. But, in our application, there will be food providers as well as food consumers. Although they are not going to explicitly declare their recipe, they are going to provide only nutritional facts and health information about their recipe. Healthy food does not have a mobile app.

### 4. Yemeksepeti ###

### 5. Twitter ###
![http://apptecnologia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/twitter-noticias.png](http://apptecnologia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/twitter-noticias.png)

#### **Description** ####
Twitter is a social-network website where people can have an account, share something and see what the other people share.
#### **Key Features** ####
  * There is only one type of user
  * There is a restriction which prevents user to tweet something more than 140 characters
  * Users can follow each other
  * There is a chatting system on Twitter
  * There is a favourite and retweet feature to keep in mind something liked and  show them to the people
#### **Users** ####
This application is used by everyone without any purposive restriction
#### **Environment** ####
It provides both web and mobile apps, and these apps are synchronized
#### **Differences** ####
There are some differences between Twitter and our product. For example, since users can share their menu or recipes in the system, there will not be a character restriction and this is a real advantage. Also, we will use some filtering system to recommend something to the user and not only with filters but also with past preferences, location etc. Chatting system is not a feature of our project. The biggest advantage is that Twitter is a global social network consists of all the topics, but our project will help people just in terms of what to eat. So it is more purposive. As another benefit, the providers have to explain the ingredients of their products. So user can easily learn he/she is. Conversely the liking or retweeting feature, our system will include a detailed ranking system. So people will give points not only to the taste, but also location, cleanliness, speed of service etc.


## Similarities to other domains ##
This application is going to be the easiest and the most interactive way for users to share their food experience. It does not only focus on calorie calculation for a food like most of its competitors do, it also focus on providing accurate information about nutritional data. Although this application differs from its competitors in various aspects as we stated above, it shares some similarities not only with them and but also with some other applications in the other domains like travel guidance.
For example,

Trip Advisor provides its users with the following functionalities: location based search, following friends' activities, saved trips list, hotel ranking system etc.

Booking.com provides its users with the following functionalities: Advanced search with tagging system in order to ease the searching process for users, filter by various properties like review scores, property types, star ratings etc

These are some of the similar functionalities that we are going to provide in our application.
