> # CROWDSOURCING #

Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson, editors at Wired Magazine, coined the term "crowdsourcing" in 2005 after conversations about how businesses were using the Internet to outsource work to individuals.[4](4.md) Howe and Robinson came to the conclusion that what was happening was like "outsourcing to the crowd," which quickly led to the portmanteau "crowdsourcing." Howe first published a definition for the term "crowdsourcing" in a companion blog post to his June 2006 Wired magazine article, "The Rise of Crowdsourcing," which came out in print just days later:[5](5.md)

"Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers."


# DIFFERENT TYPES OF CROWDSOURCING #

**Crowdsource Design**:If you’re looking for a logo design, you can tell a crowd of designers what you want, how much you will pay, and your deadline. All interested designers will create a finished design specifically for you. You’ll receive 50-300+ different finished logo designs, and you can keep whichever design you like the best. By doing design this way, crowdsourcing actually increases the quality & decreases the price, compared to online freelancing.

**Crowdfunding**:Crowdfunding involves asking a crowd of people to donate money to your project. For example, if you want to raise $10,000 to pay for studio time to record a new CD, crowdfunding can help you raise that money.. You find a crowdfunding platform, set the goal amount, deadline, and any rewards offered to donors. You must raise 100% of your goal before the deadline, or all the donations are returned to the donors. Deadlines are typically less than 60 days.

Crowdfunding is mostly used by artists, charities, & start-ups to raise money for projects such as filming a documentary, manufacturing an iPod watch, cancer research, or seed money. Read more about crowdfunding or browse crowdfunding sites.

**Microtasks** :Microtasking involves breaking work up into tiny tasks and sending the work to a crowd of people. If you have 1,000 photos on your website that need captions, you can ask 1,000 individual people to each add a caption to one photo. Break up the work and decide the payment for each completed task (typically .01¢ – .10¢ per task). With microtasking, you can expect to see results within minutes. Microtasking can involve tasks such as scanning images, proofreading, database correction and transcribing audio files.

Work is done faster, cheaper, and usually with less errors (when validation systems are in place). Additionally, microtasks can often be performed by people in less fortunate countries, including those with SMS capabilities but without computers. Read more about microtasks or browse microtasks sites.

**Open Innovation** :Open innovation brings together people from different parts of the world and different sectors of business to work together on a project. This is effectively a collection of different fields and levels of expertise that would not otherwise be available to any budding entrepreneur. It also elevates previously considered uninvolved parties, such as investors, to roll up their sleeves and impart their knowledge, essentially becoming more than just a cash cow.

**Pros & Cons** :Crowdsourcing’s biggest benefit is the ability to receive better quality results, since several people offer their best ideas, skills, & support. Crowdsourcing allows you to select the best result from a sea of ‘best entries,’ as opposed to receiving the best entry from a single provider. Results can be delivered much quicker than traditional methods, since crowdsourcing is a form of freelancing. You can get a finished video within a month, a finished design or idea within a week, and microtasks appear within minutes.

# WHY CROWDSOURCING IS USEFUL #

You see it every day on your online networks…

A business contact asks for recommendations for an open position. An old college buddy asks for restaurant suggestions in a popular city. A parent at your child’s school asks for summer camp reviews.

There’s a name for this type of request: crowdsourcing. And it’s not limited to people in your social networks. This method of seeking resources from the masses is part of a larger trend — one that enterprises are adopting to drive innovation and boost business.

Enterprises are using crowdsourcing to expand their talent pools and obtain ideas, content or services not just from current employees and suppliers, but online communities and the public as well. And because crowdsourcing provides a wider supply of resources, businesses can fine-tune the ways they use Big Data, analytics, and data enhancement.

Technology companies can use crowdsourcing for testing and finding glitches in apps and software. For example, note-taking app-maker Evernote uses UserTesting.com to record users’ actions and ask them questions — rather than exhaust its own resources conducting tests and compiling results.

Brick-and-mortar retailers could use the crowd for secret shopping to gain insight about their stores and employees. Some tasks for these crowdsourced workers could be scanning shelves for pricing mistakes or product misalignment. A retailer could also use crowdsourcing and cloud applications to launch a storefront makeover or website redesign, and solicit feedback from its target audience before a full launch.

Online businesses can use crowdsourced information about search results to make them more relevant to users, and thus, increase engagement or conversion.
